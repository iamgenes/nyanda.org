            <h3>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>
              Combining indigenous cultural practices and proven scientific
              solutions on ecological sustainability are useful to enhance
              knowledge and an opportunity for learning. Through collaborative
              research that brings together indigenous groups and renowned
              global researchers, we hope to create common ground and forge
              partnerships between indigenous science and academic and policy
              institutions. One of TESTâ€™s aims is to combine indigenous
              practices with scientific solutions in the management of cultural
              and natural ecosystems.

            <p>
              Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) are natural
              conservators of nature. Their passion and skill in landscape
              conservation must be appreciated and recognized. TEST will
              facilitate a comprehensive awareness creation program to nurture
              active and joyful involvement of IPLCs in conservation and create
              appreciation from conservation and government authorities.

              Tanzania has an ecosystem of indigenous cultures contributing to
              community as well as ecological resilience. These indigenous
              cultures have to connect and learn from each other to create
              mutually connected cultural and natural ecosystems for people and
              wildlife.
