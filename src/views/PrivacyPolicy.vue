			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			<article style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto">
				<p>
					Nyanda takes very seriously the privacy of its website and mobile app
					visitors and the security of any personal information that may be
					provided via the organizations website and mobile app. Nyanda believes
					you have the right to know the type of information the organization
					collects, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under
					which it may be disclosed. For easy access, this Privacy Policy
					Statement is posted on Nyanda's homepage, all internal website and
					mobile app pages and at every point where personally identifiable
					information may be requested.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any privacy policy provided on any specific Nyanda-branded website or
					mobile app will always supersede this general policy. Please check the
					Nyanda website(s) or mobile app(s) that you use for the applicable
					privacy policy.
				</p>
				<h4>The Information We Collect and How it is Gathered and Used</h4>
				<h5>Personal Information</h5>
				<p>
					This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
					Nyanda website or mobile app. On some pages, visitors can make
					information requests, register to receive program updates or resource
					materials, or make financial contributions. Nyanda collects only the
					personal information voluntarily provided through this website and
					mobile app. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, email
					address, contact information, and any other demographic data or
					details related to your background or interests that you choose to
					provide.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nyanda does not share personal information provided by you through its
					website or mobile app with any other institution, company, government
					or governmental agency or other organization. Nyanda is obligated to
					disclose personal information in exceptional cases as required by
					United Republic of Tanzania law, including a subpoena.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nyanda uses the information you provide about yourself for various
					services, which are disclosed to you when you provide the information.
					Examples include email newsletters, invitations to Nyanda events, or
					for information alerts about Nyanda programs or activities. In some
					cases, Nyanda uses this information, including the email addresses and
					contact information gathered from our website and mobile apps, for
					fundraising activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information collected on Nyanda website and mobile apps are never used
					for commercial purposes.
				</p>
				<h5>Email/SMS Updates</h5>
				<p>
					We use a third-party email/SMS marketing party to deliver emails and
					Short Message Service(SMS). This company employs techniques for
					tracking open rates and click-through that use email addresses/Phone
					numbers as unique identifiers.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will be given the option to remove your name from our email/SMS
					list at the bottom of each email/SMS update. We will not sell, rent or
					trade your email address/Phone Number to a third party.
				</p>
				<h5>Site/App Usage Information</h5>
				<p>
					When visitors browse, read or download information on the Nyanda
					website or mobile app, limited, anonymous data is collected about the
					visit. For instance, the web server may record the numerical Internet
					Protocol address of your computer; information about your browser and
					operating system; date and time of access; and the Internet address
					and page that linked (referred) you to our site. If you search the
					site, your search requests may be logged. Nyanda uses this information
					to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site,
					diagnose and correct system errors, and conduct research—all with the
					sole objective of improving the information services, features and
					usability of the site.
				</p>
				<h5>Cookies</h5>
				<p>
					The Nyanda website uses web cookies—a mechanism by which a website and
					a web browser can jointly “remember” information within or between
					browsing sessions. Cookies are useful because they can improve the
					user experience. However, cookies have been subject to criticism
					because they also can be employed to invisibly assemble information
					about user’s browsing habits for marketing purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nyanda uses cookies only to improve the user experience within the
					context of a single browser session or between site visits and not for
					any form of information gathering about user browsing. Cookies may
					contain a “key,” so that you do not need to login every time you visit
					a new page, or when you return to the Nyanda website from the same
					computer at a later date. Remember, if you are using a public
					computer, and you fail to log out from the website and mobile app
					after finishing your session, another person may be able to access
					your account.
				</p>
				<h5>
					Nyanda Partner website and mobile apps and Links to Independent
					website and mobile apps
				</h5>
				<p>
					The Nyanda privacy policy does not apply to such website and mobile
					apps that are developed and maintained by Nyanda partners with Nyanda
					financial or technical assistance. Nyanda would typically encourage
					these partners to develop and implement their own privacy policies for
					information collected on their website and mobile apps. It is Nyanda's
					policy never to take possession of or use personal information
					provided to partners through these kinds of website and mobile apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, Nyanda website and mobile apps may contain pages with links
					to independent, external website and mobile apps for which the
					Institute is not responsible.
				</p>
				<h5>Nyanda Commitment to Data Security</h5>
				<p>
					To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the
					correct use of information, Nyanda uses industry standard SSL (Secure
					Sockets Layer) encryption to protect the confidentiality of your
					personal information and the security of your transaction during
					transmission.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any revocation of consent may be submitted to the following email
					address: info@nyanda.com
				</p>
				<h5>Data Subject Rights and Requests</h5>

					These rights vary depending on where you reside, but may include
					rights to:
