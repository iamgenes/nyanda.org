                <p>
                    Nyanda takes very seriously the privacy of its
                    website visitors and the security of any personal
                    information that may be provided via the organizations
                    website. Nyanda believes you have the right to
                    know the type of information the organization collects, how
                    it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which
                    it may be disclosed. For easy access, this Privacy Policy
                    Statement is posted on Nyanda's homepage, all
                    internal website pages and at every point where personally
                    identifiable information may be requested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any privacy policy provided on any specific Nyanda-branded website will always supersede this
                    general policy. Please check the Nyanda
                    website(s) that you use for the applicable privacy policy.

                </h4>
                <h5>Personal Information</h5>
                <p>
                    This notice applies to all information collected or
                    submitted on the Nyanda website. On some pages,
                    visitors can make information requests, register to receive
                    program updates or resource materials, or make financial
                    contributions. Nyanda collects only the personal
                    information voluntarily provided through this website. This
                    may include, but is not limited to, your name, email
                    address, contact information, credit card information and
                    any other demographic data or details related to your
                    background or interests that you choose to provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nyanda does not share personal information
                    provided by you through its website with any other
                    institution, company, government or governmental agency or
                    other organization. Nyanda is obligated to
                    disclose personal information in exceptional cases as
                    required by US law, including a subpoena.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nyanda uses the information you provide about
                    yourself for various services, which are disclosed to you
                    when you provide the information. Examples include email
                    newsletters, invitations to Nyanda events, or
                    for information alerts about Nyanda programs or
                    activities. In some cases, Nyanda uses this
                    information, including the email addresses and contact
                    information gathered from our websites, for fundraising
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information collected on Nyanda websites are

                <h5>Email Updates</h5>
                <p>
                    We use a third-party email marketing party to deliver
                    emails. This company employs techniques for tracking open
                    rates and click-through that use email addresses as unique
                    identifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be given the option to remove your name from our
                    email list at the bottom of each email update. We will not
                    sell, rent or trade your email address to a third party.
                </p>
                <h5>Site Usage Information</h5>
                <p>
                    When visitors browse, read or download information on the
                    Nyanda website, limited, anonymous data is
                    collected about the visit. For instance, the web server may
                    record the numerical Internet Protocol address of your
                    computer; information about your browser and operating
                    system; date and time of access; and the Internet address
                    and page that linked (referred) you to our site. If you
                    search the site, your search requests may be logged. Nyanda uses this information to measure the number of
                    visitors to different sections of the site, diagnose and
                    correct system errors, and conduct research—all with the
                    sole objective of improving the information services,
                    features and usability of the site.
                </p>
                <h5>Cookies</h5>
                <p>
                    The Nyanda website uses web cookies—a mechanism
                    by which a website and a web browser can jointly “remember”
                    information within or between browsing sessions. Cookies are
                    useful because they can improve the user experience.
                    However, cookies have been subject to criticism because they
                    also can be employed to invisibly assemble information about
                    user’s browsing habits for marketing purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nyanda uses cookies only to improve the user
                    experience within the context of a single browser session or
                    between site visits and not for any form of information
                    gathering about user browsing. Cookies may contain a “key,”
                    so that you do not need to login every time you visit a new
                    page, or when you return to the Nyanda website
                    from the same computer at a later date. Remember, if you are
                    using a public computer, and you fail to log out from the
                    website after finishing your session, another person may be
                    able to access your account.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Nyanda Partner Websites and Links to Independent
                    Websites
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The Nyanda privacy policy does not apply to such
                    websites that are developed and maintained by Nyanda partners with Nyanda financial or
                    technical assistance. Nyanda would typically
                    encourage these partners to develop and implement their own
                    privacy policies for information collected on their
                    websites. It is Nyanda's policy never to take
                    possession of or use personal information provided to
                    partners through these kinds of websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, Nyanda websites may contain pages
                    with links to independent, external websites for which the
                    Institute is not responsible.
                </p>
                <h5>Nyanda Commitment to Data Security</h5>
                <p>
                    To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and
                    ensure the correct use of information, Nyanda
                    uses industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption
                    to protect the confidentiality of your personal information
                    and the security of your transaction during transmission.
                </p>
                <h5>Overview and Donor Access Rights</h5>
                <p>
                    NYANDA appreciates those individuals and
                    entities whose contributions finance NYANDA’s
                    operations (“Donors”). To that end it wishes to explicitly
                    clarify the types of Donor Information it receives, and its
                    procedures with respect to this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, in addition to other safeguards listed in this
                    privacy policy, NYANDA confirms that (unless
                    required to comply with law, statute, or regulation) it does
                    not sell or share a Donor’s Personal Data without its
                    explicit consent. A Donor that has provided such consent may
                    revoke such consent at any time via written notice and,
                    subject to exceptions stated in applicable law, NYANDA shall act in accordance with such revocation.
                    For avoidance of doubt, this addendum applies equally to
                    Donor Personal Data received through this website and any
                    other forms of information acquisition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any revocation of consent may be submitted to the following
                    email address: info@nyanda.com
                </p>
                <p>With respect to offline donations:</p>

                        NYANDA’s staff may obtain basic personal
                        data including address, email, and phone number.
                        Incidental to the form of payment, the staff involved
                        with donation in the form of a physical intake may have
                        access to information located on a check. Such physical
                        checks will be discarded upon either (a) physical
                        cashing of the check, or (b) in line with the
                        recommendations provided by [Organization’s] bank’s
                        mobile application.

                    <li>
                        Offline potential donors may prefer to provide credit
                        card information. Staff will not solicit such
                        information, and shall inform the donor of other payment
                        options, prior to accepting this information.

                    <li>
                        Staff responsible for finance and accounting may have

                        necessary for financial accounting of donations in line
                        with generally accepted practices.

                        information described in points (1)-(4). It will
                        periodically refine access rights, limiting access to
                        those reasonably having a need to know. Accounts having
