            Participatory Development of Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Protocols in Ngorongoro District, Tanzania
          </h3>
          <div class="content__text">
            <p>
              The climate change and vulnerability impacts continue to affect the indigenous communities in
              Tanzania without a tool or mechanism for regular assessment and creating awareness for solutions for
              these effects. This project aims at developing a Climate Change Adaptation Toolkit (CCA Toolkit).
              TEST will create a baseline through this Toolkit for climate change vulnerability assessments and
              adaptation as part of a future funded project on “Resilience to Climate Change”. The project aims to
              build the capacity of Maasai communities and stakeholders in Ngorongoro district to adopt and apply
              the assessment in other divisions, and to be compliant with the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based
              Assessment &quot;TESSA Toolkit&quot; for worldwide assessment and adaptation. <br /><br />
              Economies in the traditional ecosystem are highly dependent on natural resources, meaning that
              recurring climate change patterns such as recurrent droughts, erratic rainfall patterns and floods will
              continue to negatively impact livelihoods and community assets. Knowing that pastoral communities
              are at the central concern of climate change, TEST is implementing Participatory Development of
              Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Protocols in Ngorongoro District, Tanzania. This program
              operates in two divisions, Loliondo and Sale respectively. This project is funded by Australian
              Volunteers International (AVI) through Impact Funds.

            Preservation of Indigenous Knowledge
          </h3>
          <div class="content__text">
            <p>
              The <b>objective</b> of this project is to promote indigenous practices and cultural values that enhance sustainable
              natural resources management. Indigenous knowledge is the unique knowledge intrinsic to a particular
              culture or society. In most cases this type of knowledge is not written and or stored by use of any form
              of modern techniques. This knowledge is generated and transmitted by communities, over time, to cope
              with their own agro-ecological and socio-economic environments. <br /><br />
              TEST will implement this project through documentation and production in print and through video the best
              practices of the Maasai people that contribute significantly to ecological and cultural resilience. TEST will
              conduct interviews with elders, women, and youth on rituals of the indigenous Maasai people and compile
              responses in the form of a video documentary. The final documentary will be disseminated to the public
              through Loliondo FM Community radio. TEST will use the document and video to create awareness to the local
              community and the government of the importance of the indigenous best practices that support
              environmental/ecology preservation that contributes to indigenous livelihoods and conservation. <br /><br />
              TEST has embarked on journey to safeguard the Maasai indigenous knowledge thereby started by
              producing a documentary on indigenous knowledge and cultural values that enhance sustainable Natural
              Resources Management, a project implemented in Longido district, Arusha region. This project is
              funded by Global Greengrants Fund (GGF)

              CAS provides a platform to enhance social interaction and engagement and facilitate economic

              income generating activities and capacity buildings. Youth and women come together to learn skills to
